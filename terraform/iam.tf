# IAM Configuration
# Lambda-related IAM resources are now handled by the lambda-function module
# This file can be used for other IAM resources if needed in the future

# Note: All Lambda IAM roles, policies, and permissions are now managed
# by the lambda-function module in modules/lambda-function/main.tf
# This provides better encapsulation and reusability.
